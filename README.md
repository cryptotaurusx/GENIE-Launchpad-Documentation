GENIE Launchpad & $NOSHIT Coin Documentation
Welcome to the official documentation repository for the GENIE Launchpad ecosystem and its genesis token, $NOSHIT Coin.
This repository serves as a transparent and verifiable source for all core project whitepapers and the initial community campaign structure.
🚀 Project Overview: GENIE Launchpad
The GENIE Launchpad is a self-financing, DAO-governed ecosystem designed to be the safest and most creator-friendly platform in crypto. It offers:
1.	$0 Launch Cost: Free token launch infrastructure for both Utility and Non-Utility tokens.
2.	Mandatory Vesting: 10-Week Weekly Vesting Protocol for all presale, creator, and airdrop tokens to prevent rug pulls and massive dumps.
3.	Creator Incentives: Interest-free SOL loans (1-3 SOL) for creators to purchase their own token at launch, and funding for 3rd-party audits for Utility tokens.
4.	Automated Deflation: A percentage of all project transaction fees are channeled directly to the $GENIE Buy-Back and Burn Fund, driving deflation automatically.
